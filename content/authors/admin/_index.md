I’m a PhD student in English and American Literature at Washington University in St. Louis where I use computational methods to study genre, plot, and style.

I bluster on Twitter @CodyVanZandt, sling code on GitHub @Codyvanzandt, exist (at least nominally) on LinkedIn @codyvanzandt, and respond to email at cody.a.vanzandt@gmail.com.
